<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Space-Cruise <a name="about-project"></a>

**Space-Cruise** is a web application designed to serve as a central hub for space travelers. It offers two main pages, one dedicated to providing information about various rockets available through SpaceX, and the other focused on detailing ongoing missions. Users of this application can explore a catalog of rockets and have the ability to reserve a rocket for their own missions. They can also cancel their reservation in real-time if needed.

In the mission section of the app, users can view and join specific missions that interest them. Additionally, they have the option to leave a mission they previously signed up for.

A third page in the application is dedicated to user profiles. Here, users can see a summary of the rockets they have reserved and the missions they have joined.

Space-Cruise is built using the React framework and employs Redux for state management. The visual design is created using CSS.
